# Order Book GPU

Order Book GPU is a high-performance Python library designed for managing and analyzing order books in financial markets, leveraging GPU acceleration to handle high-frequency data efficiently.

## Features

- Real-time order book updates
- GPU-accelerated computations for rapid processing
- Customizable statistics and metrics computation
- Support for multiple financial instruments

## Installation
Order Book GPU can be installed using pip.

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/order-book-gpu.git
cd order-book-gpu
pip install .
``` 

## To Run

```
from order_book import OrderBookClientGPU
symbols = ["BTCUSDT", "ETHUSDT"]
orderbook_client = OrderBookClientGPU(symbols, custom_stat_fn=None, path='.')
orderbook_client.start()
``` 

## Opening and Reading Order Books: Refer to tests/eval_GPU.py

```
from order_book import OrderBookTorch
import json


### just to convert an order book to JSON for evaluation
s = "ETHUSDT"
filename = f"{s}_order_book.bin"

with open(filename, 'rb') as file:
    data = file.read()
    order_book = OrderBookTorch.deserialize(data)

saved_data = {update_id: {
            'bids': frame['bids'].cpu().tolist(),
            'asks': frame['asks'].cpu().tolist(),
            'stats': frame['stats']
        } for update_id, frame in order_book.frames.items()}

with open(filename.split('.')[0]+'.json', 'ab') as file2:
    file2.write(json.dumps(saved_data).encode('utf-8'))

print(order_book.frames.keys())
```
